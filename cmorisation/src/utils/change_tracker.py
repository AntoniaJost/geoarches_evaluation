    """
    Determine whether to force a rerun of a pipeline step based on detected changes.

    Logic depends on the `means_changed.json` file, which tracks whether upstream means
    were recalculated. The decision rule is:
    
    - For 'daily' steps: rerun only if any changed year is â‰¤ 1979
    - For 'monthly' steps: rerun if any year has changed

    Parameters:
    base_name : str
        Either "daily" or "monthly", depending on which step is being evaluated.
    logger : logging.Logger, optional
        Logger for debug or warning messages.

    Returns
    bool: True if rerun is required, False otherwise.
